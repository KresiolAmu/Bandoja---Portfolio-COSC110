# BANDOJA - Portfolio
Completion requirement for course COSC 110 - Numerical and Symbolic Computation

Laboratory 1
- Objective is to analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.
- Implement a simple rule-based model for predicting survival.
- Load and inspect the dataset, identify missing data, compute survival rates, and analyze survival based on age using Python (pandas and matplotlib).
- The output here is a set of analyzed patterns and simple rule-based insights that help explain factors influencing passenger survival.

Laboratory 2
- Objective is to learn how to handle missing values, remove duplicates, convert data types, and more.
- Use the cleaned dataset for basic data analysis.
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset, clean the data through various steps, and save the cleaned version for analysis.
- The output here is a cleaned dataset and basic visualizations that provide insights into the factors affecting the data.

Laboratory 3
- Objective is to apply basic symbolic calculations using SymPy.
- Perform symbolic calculations, solve and simplify expressions, define equations using symbols, and expand algebraic expressions.
- The output here is a set of solved, simplified, and expanded symbolic expressions that demonstrate foundational algebra skills using SymPy.

Laboratory 4
- Objective is to explore how Python can be used to understand basic ideas in calculus â€” without needing to do any complex math.
- Experiment with symbolic operations, compute limits and derivatives, perform series expansions, and solve basic algebraic equations.
- The output here is a set of interpreted symbolic results that build intuitive understanding of calculus concepts through Python experimentation.
